# bpy_BatchExportHelper
Turned Blenders BatchExport template into an add-on.
Currently supports FBX only but planning to add more support options for convenience sake.

Was literally just a little practice thing to get into the API but i needed the thing for work anyways so maybe it's helpful to ppl heh.
