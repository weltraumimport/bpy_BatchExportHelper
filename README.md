# bpy_BatchExportHelper
Turned Blenders BatchExport template into an add-on.
<br/>
This add-on exports all selected objects in the scene into seperate files in the .blend file directory.
<br/>
Currently supports FBX only but planning to add more support options for convenience sake.
<br/>
<br/>
Was literally just a little practice thing to get into the API but i needed the thing for work anyways so maybe it's helpful to ppl heh.
<br/>
Install the .py like any other add-on. There should be a Button in the 3D Viewport side panel.
