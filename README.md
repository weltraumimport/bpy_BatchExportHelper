# bpy_BatchExportHelper
Turned Blenders BatchExport template into an add-on.
This add-on exports all selected objects in the scene into seperate files in the .blend file directory.
Currently supports FBX only but planning to add more support options for convenience sake.

Was literally just a little practice thing to get into the API but i needed the thing for work anyways so maybe it's helpful to ppl heh.

Install the .py like any other add-on. There should be a Button in the 3D Viewport side panel.
